# Health-Care-System-POV
# Health Care System POV

A comprehensive C++ console application simulating a Health Care System with separate interfaces for patients and doctors. This project leverages object-oriented programming, file handling, and time management to create an interactive health care management system.

## Features

- **Patient and Doctor Interface**: Two separate applications within the system cater to patients and doctors, allowing operations specific to each role.
- **Encryption and Security**: Utilizes basic encryption techniques to secure patient records and ensures data privacy.
- **Dynamic Record Handling**: The system can generate, encrypt, and manage health records dynamically, supporting operations like booking appointments and recording medical histories.
- **Real-time Interaction Simulation**: Simulate real-time interactions such as voice or video calls with time tracking.
- **Access Control Management**: Manage and restrict access to sensitive patient data based on permissions.
